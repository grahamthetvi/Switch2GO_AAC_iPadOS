# Firebase in Vocable

### Status
Firebase has been **completely removed** from this project to ensure zero data collection from student devices.

Previously, the app was connected to Firebase for Crashlytics and Analytics, but all Firebase dependencies, plugins, and configuration have been removed to maintain complete privacy.

### What Was Removed
- Firebase Crashlytics SDK and plugin
- Firebase Analytics SDK
- Google Services plugin
- `google-services.json` configuration file

### Impact
- No crash reports are collected
- No analytics data is transmitted
- All app functionality remains intact
- Complete privacy for student users
