The app has been customized with CVI-friendly features including:
- Simplified, high-contrast symbol layouts
- Customizable symbol colors and sizes
- Reduced visual complexity
- Configurable symbol count per page (2-9 symbols)
- Eye gaze and head tracking support for hands-free operation

## What is Switch2Go?
Switch2Go is an Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) application designed specifically for students with Cerebral Visual Impairment. It allows users to communicate using customizable symbol-based interfaces, with support for head tracking and eye gaze technology for hands-free operation.

## Features

### CVI-Optimized Interface
- **Configurable Symbol Layouts**: Choose from 2-9 symbols per page to reduce visual complexity
- **Customizable Colors**: Set high-contrast colors for each symbol position to improve visibility
- **Adjustable Text Sizes**: Multiple text size options to accommodate different visual needs
- **Simplified Design**: Clean, uncluttered interface designed for CVI users

### Multimodal User Interface
Switch2Go uses ARCore to track the user's head movements and eye gaze technology to understand where the user is looking on the screen. This allows the app to be used completely hands-free: users can look around the screen and make selections by lingering their gaze at a particular element.

For users with more mobility, the app can be operated by touch.

### Saved Phrases
Use a list of common phrases, or create and save your own custom phrases with customizable appearance settings.

### Full QWERTY Keyboard
Type with your head, eyes, or hands.

## Device Requirements
- [Android devices with Android OS 8 or higher.]
- [iOS some version or higher but honestly I didnt want to make so that only devices with IR sensors could use the app so I made it so more devices could use the app]
